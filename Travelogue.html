I strongly believe that travel broadens the mind. Not that I have circumnavigated the earth, but I have been to a couple of places. It started with <a href="images/Country01.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"> <font color="#00FFFF">Singapore</font></a> <div class="highslide-caption">  Singapore (1989) - Finally, I&rsquo;m abroad</div> and <a href="images/Country02.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"> <font color="#00FFFF">Malaysia</font></a> <div class="highslide-caption">  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (1989) - I AM NOT STARING!</div>
 in 1989. After a long hiatus, Amma and I went to 
<a href="images/Country03.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)">
<font color="#00FFFF">Sri Lanka</font></a>
<div class="highslide-caption">  Negombo, Sri Lanka (2002) - Creepy Halo</div>
 in 2001. We later followed up with 
<a href="images/Country04.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)">
<font color="#00FFFF">Dubai</font></a>
<div class="highslide-caption">  Dubai, United Arab Emirates (2003) - I&rsquo;ll quit when you do!</div>
for the shopping festival in 2002. Later in 2003, I went to Germany to study <a href="images/Country05.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)">
<font color="#00FFFF">(really?)</font></a><div class="highslide-caption">  Nürburg, Germany (2006) - The Beer Bong - One liter of beer in 10 seconds flat. I also got to see Metallica, later that day</div> and wanted to see Europe in all its splendor and glory. From here I managed to visit <a href="images/Country06.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">France</font></a><div class="highslide-caption">  Paris, France (2004) - First time in Paris with Amma</div>, <a href="images/Country07.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)">

The Cliffs of Moher are like a 2 hour drive from here</div>. Later, when I was in Madras during the summer of 2006, we (Amma, Chitti, Sahana and I) visited <a href="images/Country10.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Hong Kong</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Hong Kong (2006) - 3 Children and 1 Adult</div>, <a href="images/Country11.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Thailand</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Pattaya, Thailand (2006) - OK..that&rsquo;s a dude</div> and <a href="images/Country12.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">China</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Shenzhen, China (2006) - Wait...that&rsquo;s not what I meant by a turtle neck</div>.
<br><br>
Having lived in 3 different countries for a significant amount of time, I wanted to make the best use of it. Starting with India, I have been to most of the big cities. The earliest I remember was <a href="images/Travel01.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Bangalore</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Look how thin I was</div>. It felt like a whole new country. More recently the guys and I went to <a href="images/Travel02.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Kodaikanal</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Karthik really thinks he&rsquo;s wikipedia personified</div> and later I took Xiaojie to <a href="images/Travel03.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Goa</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Well red, perhaps?</div>. Apart from this, I really cannot talk about one particular trip because there are so many. 
<br><br>
In 2003, I moved to Germany and I think this is where I really started to get around. One of my very first trips was to Dresden with Dr. Govindan, his family and Muthu. I remember this vividly as this where I first saw <a href="images/Travel04.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">snow</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Kinderjoy</div>. From Dresden, Muthu and I visited Berlin as well. By the beginning of the second semester, our department arranged for a class trip to the island of Sylt. We were supposed to observe the morphology of the islands. So they said. But boy, did we have a <a href="images/Travel05.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">good time</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> When life gives you lemons.. </div>! Meanwhile, Amma visited me in Germany and we went to <a href="images/Travel06.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Munich</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> I have nothing to say about this picture </div>, <a href="images/Travel07.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Dresden</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Looks like the guy is doing something else </div> and Berlin apart from going to Paris. 
<br><br>
In July 2006, I moved to <a href="images/Travel08.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">China</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> I know.. </div> lock, stock and barrel. Beijing was much more developed than I imagined. The sky was never blue though. Anyway, a month later, Xiaojie’s colleagues took us on a short trip to Bashang. This was a “grassland” about 3 hours away from Beijing. It was so much <a href="images/Travel09.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">fun</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying </div>. During the national holidays in October, Xiaojie, her colleagues and I traveled to <a href="images/Travel10.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Hangzhou</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Blood, sweat and tears </div>, a beautiful city close to Shanghai. I had always wanted to see Shanghai and we could not then. On December 31st 2007, when Xiaojie and I were thinking how to spend New Year’s Eve, I suggested <a href="images/Travel11.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Shanghai</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Happy New Year </div>. Within a few minutes we booked the flight tickets and a room at the Hilton, and were there in 5 hours! We spent the New Year in style.
<br><br>
I dream of visiting Antarctica some day and I’d also like to retrace the Silk Route. Nevertheless, of all my travels, I have 2 favorites - “The Trip” and “The Trip 2”.

I call it simply The Trip. It was my first ever backpacking trip and I did it all alone. I had saved some money and was eager to see Europe. I started planning by the end of October 2004 and decided I was going to take the trains with an Inter-Rail pass. The <a href="images/TheTrip_00.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">route</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> The Trip </div> was set and I started off from Kiel in December 2004.
<br><br>
The first leg of my journey was from Paris. I had an <a href="images/TheTrip_01.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">overnight train</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Singin&rsquo; in the train </div> to <a href="images/TheTrip_02.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Girona</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Gateway to Spain </div> (near Barcelona). It was nice to be in <a href="images/TheTrip_03.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Barcelona</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> One of my best photos </div>, although I had not realized how difficult it would be without speaking Spanish! From here, I moved to <a href="images/TheTrip_04.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Madrid</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Not that I knew what it was </div> and also got to check out <a href="images/TheTrip_05.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Toledo</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Quite sunny </div> and <a href="images/TheTrip_06.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Segovia</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> I learned something about myself that day </div>. Pablo, a colleague from CORELAB, had suggested I check Sevilla out. Went there and thought there was nothing significant. How wrong was I? There it was. An orange tree! I had never seen one before. The place where I am from had a lot of others (Mangoes, Coconut) but oranges? Pablo was right. When I look at the photos today, they look more like <a href="images/TheTrip_07.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Clementine</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> The tree </div>. May be, but who cares?
<br><br>
From here I went to <a href="images/TheTrip_08.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Lisbon</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> War memorial of a Sword </div>. It was surreal. I had not realized that not talking to anyone for a few days, made me want to implode. What was I thinking when I started without learning a few words in Spanish / Portuguese? Anyway, Lisboa was superb. Blue sky, cheap wine and nice food.  By now it was the 24th of December and I had to get to <a href="images/TheTrip_10.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Redondela</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Heaven on earth </div>. Pablo had invited me to his place there for Christmas. It was heaven on earth. The view from his room was fantastic. His mom had prepared a <a href="images/TheTrip_09.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">great lunch</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Sea food galore </div> but there was a little problem. See, back then I did not eat sea food. The poor thing felt bad (I was worse) and quickly fried some potatoes and eggs.
<br><br>
My next stop was San Sebastian, a beautiful coastal town in Spain close to the French border. Well, I was there in December’s winter and did not care much for it until I saw the beach. Inspired me to make a <a href="images/TheTrip_11.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">panorama</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> My first pano ever </div> of it. My next stop was Paris where Sebastien, another colleague, invited me over. His parents had a nice house in the suburbs. Stayed there for 2 days, had <a href="images/TheTrip_12.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">nice food</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Bon appetit </div> and then moved on to Luxembourg.
<br><br>
I met with Dr. Govindan, a friend from Kiel, and his family in <a href="images/TheTrip_13.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Lux</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> In Lux </div> and from there we went to <a href="images/TheTrip_14.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Brussels</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Bruxelles </div>. I have to say his place in Germany, was my home away from home. Anyway, I then wanted to go to Holland and I again lodged at Sebastien’s. He was doing his Master’s thesis there and had rented an apartment. From here I went to <a href="images/TheTrip_15.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Rotterdam</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Hobo in Rotterdam </div> and Amsterdam before heading back home. What a trip it was!

		Having had a great trip in 2004, I wanted to do something similar again. I started planning by October 2005 and wanted to cover as much as possible using the Inter-Rail. This time however I wanted to visit Egypt apart from covering <a href="images/TheTrip2_00.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">northern and southern Europe</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> The Trip 2 </div>. A special thanks to Xiaojie who traveled to Hamburg to get me my visa. 
<br><br>
I started off from Kiel at around 5:00 AM on a Saturday and took a weekend ticket. In Germany, with this ticket one can take all “normal” trains without paying extra. I think I made the best use of this ticket by getting all the way to Munich. I remember changing 7 trains to get there and you can imagine how exhausting that would have been. Having reached Munich by around 19:00, I lodged at Ashutosh’s (from my University who later moved to Munich) place. I was pretty excited about my flight to Cairo 2 days later.
<br><br>
I reached <a href="images/TheTrip2_01.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Cairo</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> HEYYYY...CAN YOU HEAR ME </div> late at night and was glad to see someone from the youth hostel waiting to pick me up. Cairo seemed so much like India but the roads were better. People often asked where I was from and constantly mentioned “Amitabh Bachchan”.  He’s a phenomenon there. I loved the food, especially <a href="images/TheTrip2_03.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">kushari</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Inexpensive and was a staple </div>, and was pigging out after eating European food for a year. I visited Aswan from there and cruised with <a href="images/TheTrip2_04.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Captain Ruby</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> The captain, Petty Officer and I </div> on the Nile. After spending about 5 days in Egypt I took a flight back to Munich.
<br><br>
Back in Germany, Ashutosh and I visited <a href="images/TheTrip2_05.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Salzburg</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Ashutosh in Salzburg </div> and later I left for Karlsruhe from Munich. I stayed at Ajay’s (cousin) for about 4 days. You cannot imagine how much I was craving for <a href="images/TheTrip2_06.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">home-cooked-south-Indian-food</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Hungry this very moment </div>. Viji and Ajay were the perfect hosts and put up with me for 3 days. I traveled to <a href="images/TheTrip2_07.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Zurich</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> On this day I learned Zurich was not the capital city </div> and Bern from here before heading back to Kiel for Christmas.
<br><br>
From Kiel, I <a href="images/TheTrip2_08.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">traveled north</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> This train was actually ON a ferry. Nenja Nakkitaan  </div> and reached Malmo via Copenhagen. A friend’s friend was supposed to pick me up from the station. Keep in mind it was winter and I was in a different country. As luck would have it, this guy never showed up! I waited for 2 hours before checking myself in at a hotel. From here I wanted to get to a town called Bodoe in Norway. <a href="images/TheTrip2_09.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Bodoe</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> I guess it was around 8 AM  </div> is situated just above the Arctic Circle and I simple wanted to cross that. I reached Bodoe at 06:00 and stayed there till 18:00. From here I got back to <a href="images/TheTrip2_10.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Oslo</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> See..I do not care for your tantrum  </div>, spent a day and headed to <a href="images/TheTrip2_11.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Stockholm</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Happy New Year </div> for the New Year. From here, I took a ferry to <a href="images/TheTrip2_12.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Helsinki</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> Duh..That&rsquo;s not the ferry </div>. I retraced my route and reached <a href="images/TheTrip2_13.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><font color="#00FFFF">Copenhagen</font></a><div class="highslide-caption"> I had just lost €100 </div> before heading back home after 30 days.
